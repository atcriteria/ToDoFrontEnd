# ToDoFrontEnd

## About

The front end application for a not-so-simple ToDo app. The application itself uses both a custom back end and a database to create, submit, and retrieve ToDo's. All CRUD applications are completed on the front end and submitted to the back end on each change. Doing it this way allows the application to be much more seamless as it does not have to wait on the back end to talk with the database and then make adjustments based on that response, but instead allows us to queue up changes in the order they are received.

Currently the application does not allow users to be created unless done so statically on the back end by an administrator. This is in the event that I host the application because I don't want to be responsible for any sort of user data and the application does not make use of third party API's like OAuth to do it for me.

This was a for-fun application to create as I learned and practiced both SASS and MongoDB.

## Goals

There are no future goals planned for this project.
